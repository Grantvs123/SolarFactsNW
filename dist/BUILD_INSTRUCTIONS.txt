===================================================

This guide explains how to compile the SolarFactsNW Windows installer using Inno Setup.

PREREQUISITES
-------------
1. Windows PC (Windows 10/11 recommended)
2. Inno Setup 6.x or later
3. SolarFactsNW source code

STEP 1: INSTALL INNO SETUP
---------------------------

4. Choose "Full installation" to include all components
5. The installer will create shortcuts in your Start Menu

STEP 2: PREPARE THE SOURCE FILES
---------------------------------
1. Ensure you have the complete SolarFactsNW source code
2. Copy this entire 'dist' folder to your Windows PC
3. Place the 'dist' folder inside your SolarFactsNW project directory
4. Verify the directory structure looks like this:
   SolarFactsNW/
   ├── dist/
   │   ├── SolarFactsNW.iss
   │   ├── license.txt
   │   ├── readme.txt
   │   ├── start_solarfactsnw.bat
   │   └── BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.txt
   ├── package.json
   ├── settings.js
   ├── scripts/
   └── [other SolarFactsNW files]

STEP 3: COMPILE THE INSTALLER
------------------------------
Method 1 - Using Inno Setup GUI:
1. Open Inno Setup Compiler from Start Menu
2. Click "Open" and browse to SolarFactsNW/dist/SolarFactsNW.iss
3. Click "Build" menu > "Compile" (or press F9)
4. The compiler will process the script and create the installer
5. Look for "SolarFactsNW-Setup-v1.0.0.exe" in the dist folder

Method 2 - Using Command Line:
1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell
2. Navigate to your SolarFactsNW/dist directory
3. Run: "C:\Program Files (x86)\Inno Setup 6\ISCC.exe" SolarFactsNW.iss
4. The installer will be created in the same directory

STEP 4: TEST THE INSTALLER
---------------------------
1. Locate the generated "SolarFactsNW-Setup-v1.0.0.exe" file
2. Test on a clean Windows system (or virtual machine)
3. Run the installer and verify:
   - Installation completes without errors
   - Files are copied to C:\Program Files\SolarFactsNW
   - Start Menu shortcuts are created
   - Desktop shortcut works (if selected)
   - Node.js detection works properly
   - Application launches correctly after installation

STEP 5: DISTRIBUTE THE INSTALLER
---------------------------------
1. The final installer file is: SolarFactsNW-Setup-v1.0.0.exe
2. This single file contains everything needed for installation
3. Users can run this file to install SolarFactsNW on their systems
4. No additional files are needed for distribution

CUSTOMIZATION OPTIONS
----------------------
To modify the installer, edit SolarFactsNW.iss and change:

- Version number: Update #define MyAppVersion "1.0.0"
- Company name: Update #define MyAppPublisher "Your Company"
- Installation directory: Modify DefaultDirName
- Required Node.js version: Change MinNodeVersion constant
- Files to include/exclude: Modify [Files] section
- Shortcuts: Customize [Icons] section

After making changes, recompile using Step 3.

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------
Common issues and solutions:

1. "File not found" errors during compilation:
   - Verify all source files exist in the correct locations
   - Check that paths in the .iss file are correct
   - Ensure you're running from the correct directory

2. "Access denied" errors:
   - Run Inno Setup as Administrator
   - Check file permissions on source directories
   - Temporarily disable antivirus software

3. Large installer size:
   - The installer includes all source files except node_modules
   - This is normal and expected for Node.js applications
   - Users will need to run 'npm install' after installation

4. Node.js detection not working:
   - The installer checks registry entries for Node.js
   - Some Node.js installations may not create these entries
   - Users can still proceed with installation manually

5. Compilation takes a long time:
   - This is normal for projects with many files
   - The LZMA compression creates smaller installers but takes longer
   - You can change Compression=lzma to Compression=zip for faster builds

ADVANCED FEATURES
-----------------
The installer includes several advanced features:

1. Node.js Version Detection:
   - Automatically detects installed Node.js version
   - Warns if version is too old or missing
   - Allows user to continue installation anyway

2. Configuration Preservation:
   - Preserves existing .env.local files during updates
   - Uses onlyifdoesntexist and uninsneveruninstall flags

3. Modern UI:
   - Uses WizardStyle=modern for contemporary appearance
   - Supports window resizing and high-DPI displays

4. Comprehensive Uninstall:
   - Removes all installed files and folders
   - Cleans up generated files (logs, temporary files)
   - Preserves user configuration files

5. Professional Metadata:
   - Includes version information in the executable
   - Proper Windows integration with Add/Remove Programs
   - Digital signature support (requires code signing certificate)
